    "## Description:\n",
    "* Face Detection: The project begins by using the YOLOv8 model for detecting faces in the real-time webcam feed. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a highly efficient deep learning model designed for object detection, ensuring fast and reliable face localization.\n",
    "* Emotion Classification: Once a face is detected, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify the facial expression into one of the predefined emotional classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The CNN is trained on a labeled dataset containing facial images of people showing different emotions.\n",
    "* Real-Time Processing: The webcam captures frames, and for each frame, the system detects faces and predicts emotions continuously. The predicted emotion is displayed on the screen, making the system suitable for interactive use.\n",
    "* Technology Stack:\n",
    "1. YOLOv8 for real-time face detection.\n",
    "2. Keras/TensorFlow for training and implementing the emotion classification model.\n",
    "3. OpenCV for webcam interaction, image pre-processing, and displaying results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result:\n",
    "* The system successfully detects faces from a live webcam feed and classifies the facial expressions with good accuracy.\n",
    "* Model Performance: The emotion classifier provides reliable predictions, with higher confidence for expressions like \"happy\" and \"angry,\" though performance may vary under different conditions like poor lighting or occlusion.\n",
    "* User Interaction: The interface updates in real-time with the emotion prediction displayed on the screen as soon as the user changes their expression in front of the webcam. "
